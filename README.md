# BCStu

BStu is an application that generates random users from <a href="http://randomuser.me/">http://api.randomuser.me/</a>
in a JSON Format.  This application's purpose was solely for testing API's and for educational purposes only.

It demonstrates proper usage of converting JSON Formatted Text into a Java Object and how to display an image on a JComponent from a URL or file.

This project is only 80% complete as it is missing:
<ul>
  <li>Full information of students.</li>
  <li>Dynamic Look and Feel dependent of Operating System.</li>
  <li>Load JSON Data from given URL/File.</li>
</ul>

This application uses the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">gson</a> - For parsing JSON data types.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/imgscalr-java-image-scaling-library/">imgscalr - For scaling profile pictures.
</ul>

BCStu was created and developed by Markus Tonsaker.
